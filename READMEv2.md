## Overview

*Provide a high-level process summary with an optional pipeline diagram.*                                       

This project implements a generic pipeline for data ingestion, processing, and analysis. It can be customized to suit different types of workflows.

**Example Workflow Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Data] --> B[Processing Tool 1] --> C[Intermediate Output]
    C --> D[Processing Tool 2] --> E[Final Output]
```

---

## Data

*Provide information on input data formats, structure, and sources.*

Example data used:

- **Dataset 1**: FASTQ reads retrieved from NCBI on 2025-01-01.
- **Dataset 2**: Reference genome in FASTA format from Ensembl, downloaded on 2025-01-01.

To download the data:

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/path/to/dataset1.tar.gz
```

---

## Parameters

*Provide details or a table of configuration options and their descriptions.*

| Parameter          | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `input_folder`     | Path to the input data folder.                     |
| `output_folder`    | Path to folder to write results into.                |
| `enable_logging`   | Whether to log execution steps (`true` or `false`).|

## Usage

*Provide information on any pre-requisites, instructions on installation, configuration, and execution of the pipeline, and notes if any.*

### Pre-requisites

- Conda 
- Python 3.9+
- Recommended OS: Linux

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create the Conda environment
```
conda env create -f your-repo/config/environment.yml
conda activate conda_env
```

3. Configure pipeline parameters:
   Edit the `config.yaml` file to specify paths to your input data and desired settings if your pipeline uses one.

4. Execute the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python script.py --input input_folder fastq_files --output_folder results
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary and output files.
