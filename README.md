[![EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-EN-blue.svg)](README.md)

> ℹ️ *NOTES:*
>
> - *The README should be maintained in both English ([README.md](README.md)) and French ([README_FR.md](README_FR.md)), and be linked to the language badges above (created using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)).*
> - *All technical documentation should reside outside the README, such as in a dedicated user guide ([docs/user-guide.md](/docs/user-guide.md)), which may be maintained in either English or French, or where resources allow and demand exists, in both languages.*
> - *Instructions on preparing the README and technical documentation are provided within each file under section headers (👉 in italics) followed by an example content.*
> - *The format of the README template has been designed such that in most use cases, only the `About` and `Credits` sections need be replaced by the user. However, the format may be changed/adapted as needed, provided the content under the sections indicated below as required are included. For instance, if the combined content is brief, the four sections - `Credits`, `Citation`, `Contribution`, and `References` - may be consolidated into a single section titled `Acknowledgements`.*

## Table of Contents

> 👉 *OPTIONAL:
>
> - The Table of Contents (TOC) may be omitted if the overall content is brief.
> - The TOC can be autogenerated, for example, by running command [Create Table of Contents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one#table-of-contents) in the VSCode extension `Markdown All in One`. To exclude a heading from appearing in the autogenerated TOC, add `<!-- omit in toc -->` at the end of that heading or just above it. The TOC will be auto-updated whenever the file is saved after heading changes.*
