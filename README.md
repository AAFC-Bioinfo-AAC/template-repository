## About

*Provide a summary, purpose, and key features of the project.*

*Example **About**:*

This repository serves as a template for creating reproducible and customizable data processing workflows. It is designed to help researchers and developers quickly set up new projects by providing modular and parameterized components that can be easily adapted to different use cases. The template may be customized, adding/removing sections as needed, while maintaining good documentation.

## Usage

*Provide information on any pre-requisites, instructions on installation, configuration, and execution of the pipeline, and notes if any.*

*Example Usage:*

### Pre-requisites

- Conda 
- Python 3.9+
- Recommended OS: Linux

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create the Conda environment
```
conda env create -f your-repo/config/environment.yml
conda activate conda_env
```

3. Configure pipeline parameters:
   Edit the `config.yaml` file to specify paths to your input data and desired settings if your pipeline uses one.

4. Execute the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python script.py --input input_folder fastq_files --output_folder results
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary and output files.
