> 👉 NOTE:  
> The README should be maintained in both English (README.md) and French (README_FR.md), and be linked to the language badges above. You may adapt the README template as needed, provided the content described under all required sections below are included. For instance, if the content is brief, the four sections - Credits, Citation, Contribution, and References - may be consolidated into a single section titled Acknowledgements.
>
> Documentation necessary for usage and reproducibility should reside outside the README, such as in `docs/user-guide.md`, and that document may be maintained in either language, or both, where resources allow and demand exists.

It is designed to help researchers and developers quickly set up new projects by providing modular and parameterized components that can be easily adapted to different use cases. The template may be customized, adding/removing sections as needed, while maintaining good documentation.
