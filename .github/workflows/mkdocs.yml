# mkdocs.yml
# This file is used to automate the deployment of MkDocs documentation to GitHub Pages.
# It is triggered by events such as pushing changes to the main branch or specific documentation branches.

# Purpose:
# - Builds and deploys the MkDocs site from the content in the `docs/` directory.
# - The main page is generated from `index.md` in the `docs` directory.
# - Additional markdown files from the `docs` directory can be included as pages in the documentation, 
#   referenced via the `nav` section in the root-level `mkdocs.yml`.

# The following is an example workflow that checks out the repository, installs MkDocs and dependencies, builds the site, 
# and deploys the generated content to GitHub Pages. Replace or customize this workflow if/when applicable for your project.
# For more details on configuring MkDocs workflows with GitHub Actions, refer to:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows
