# test.yml
# This file can be used with GitHub Actions so that the workflow runs the project's test suite to validate functionality.
# It is triggered on key events, such as code pushes or pull requests, to ensure new changes do not break the existing project.

# Purpose:
# - Helps ensure that critical steps of the project produce expected results after changes are made to the codebase.

# Example: Tests could validate:
# - Accuracy of intermediate steps like alignment, variant calling, or annotations.
# - Consistency of output files across different input datasets.

# The following is a placeholder GitHub Actions workflow for demonstration purposes.
# Replace the content of this file with your actual build/test steps if/when applicable.
# For example workflows and configuration tips, refer to:
