# .gitignore
# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore when tracking changes in this repository.
# Ignored files will not be included in commits or pushed to the remote repository.

# Basic Rules:
# - Lines starting with "#" are comments and ignored by Git.
# - To ignore a file, write its name (e.g., "example.txt").
# - To ignore all files in a directory, use a trailing slash (e.g., "logs/").
# - Use "*" as a wildcard to match multiple files (e.g., "*.log" ignores all .log files).
# - To un-ignore a specific file in an ignored directory, use "!" (e.g., "!important.txt").

# Common Examples:
# Ignore all log files
# *.log
# Ignore environment files (often used for secrets or configurations)
# .env
# Ignore compiled files (e.g., Python bytecode)
# *.pyc
# __pycache__/
# Ignore dependency directories
# venv/
